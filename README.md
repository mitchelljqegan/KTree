# KTree

This is an OOP implementation of the *K-tree*, written in *C#*. The [K-tree](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/16976/) is a balanced hierarchical data structure and clustering algorithm. It is most applicable to the clustering of large data sets, where the data is typically multi-dimensional. Its hierarchical structure allows for swift data retrieval through means of a nearest-neighbour search.
